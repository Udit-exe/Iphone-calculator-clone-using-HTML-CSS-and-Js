Built this functional Iphone calculator clone as my first JavaScript Project.
All the buttons in the calculator works properly and are functional
With the help of JavaScript, I used Buttons as an string type input and by 
using eval function I evaluated the whole string.

With the help of HTML added the basic operators like :"+,-,/,*" in calculator
and styled the page with the help of CSS.
